# GitHub Actions Reusable Workflows Library

A collection of reusable GitHub Actions workflows for Node.js/TypeScript/React projects.

## üìã Available Workflows

### JavaScript/TypeScript Workflows

- **[CI Workflow](workflows/nodejs/ci.yml)**: Lint, test, and build Node.js/TypeScript/React projects

## üöÄ How to Use

These workflows are designed to be reusable across repositories. You can call them from your own GitHub Actions workflows.

### Example: Using the Node.js CI Workflow

Create a `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file in your repository:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  lint-test-build:
    uses: rhinolabs/actions-library/workflows/nodejs/ci.yml@v1
    with:
      node-version: '22'
      package-manager: 'bun'
      lint-command: 'lint'
      test-command: 'test'
      build-command: 'build'
```

## üì¶ Versioning

This repository uses [GitHub's Release Drafter](https://github.com/release-drafter/release-drafter) to manage releases and versioning automatically:

- Version numbers follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`)
- Release Drafter automatically determines the next version number based on PR labels:
  - `breaking`: Triggers a MAJOR version bump
  - `enhancement`: Triggers a MINOR version bump
  - All other changes: PATCH version bump

### Using Specific Versions

When using these workflows in your repository, you can specify:

```yaml
# Latest from main branch (not recommended for production)
uses: rhinolabs/actions-library/workflows/nodejs/ci.yml@main

# Specific version (recommended for stability)
uses: rhinolabs/actions-library/workflows/nodejs/ci.yml@v1.0.0

# Latest minor version (good balance of stability and features)
uses: rhinolabs/actions-library/workflows/nodejs/ci.yml@v1
```
